## Campaigns

The campaigns handled in the online description are:

- Arctic CLoud Observations Using airborne measurements during polar Day [ACLOUD](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~ehrlich/ACLOUD_wiki_doku/doku.php) (data at {cite:t}`EhrlichCollectionDataSources2019`) 
- Airborne measurements of radiative and turbulent FLUXes of energy and momentum in the Arctic boundary layer [AFLUX](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~ehrlich/AFLUX_wiki_doku/doku.php?id=start) (data at {cite:t}`MechCollectionDataSets2021`)
- MOSAiC Airborne observations in the Central Arctic [MOSAiC-ACA](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~ehrlich/MOSAiC_ACA_wiki_doku/doku.php?id=start) (data at {cite:t}`MechCollectionDataSets2021a`)

In spring 2022, the [HALO-(AC)<sup>3</sup>](https://halo-ac3.de/) campaign will be conducted with the three aircraft HALO, Polar 5, and Polar 6. HALO will operate out of Kiruna (Sweden), whereas Polar 5 and Polar 6 will be based in Longyearbyen (Svalbard, Norway).

In addition, the flight tracks and sea ice coverage of the Polar Airborne Measurements and Arctic Regional Climate Model Simulation Project [PAMARCMiP](https://www.ac3-tr.de/overview/observations/pamarcmip-2018/) have been included.

During [ACLOUD](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~ehrlich/ACLOUD_wiki_doku/doku.php) the campaign Physical feedback of Arctic PBL, Sea ice, Cloud And AerosoL (PASCAL) was conducted by the research vessel Polarstern. The ship track of the Polarstern RV is part of the data catalog. This will be important for analyzing Polarstern overflights.
