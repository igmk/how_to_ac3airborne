# Introduction
Welcome to the world of AC3 airborne data! It's a collection of python code examples to get you started with the airborne data. It follows the concept and ideass of the work done within the [EUREC4A](https://eurec4a.pages.gwdg.de/how_to_eurec4a/intro.html) community.

## Idea
The book chapters show datasets that are accessible online, i.e. you donâ€™t have to download anything. Most datasets are accessed via the [ac3airborne intake catalog](https://github.com/igmk/ac3airborne-intake), which simply said takes care of the links to datasets in their most recent version. The scripts typically contain at minimum how to get a specific dataset and some simple plots of basic quantities. Most chapters include additional information from aircraft flight segments or further eurec4a meta data, sometimes more sophisticated plots, or also a combination of variables from different datasets.
