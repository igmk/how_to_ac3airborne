# Airborne campaigns within and platforms operated AC<sup>3</sup>
## Campaigns

Several airborne campaigns in the Arctic have been conducted in the framework of (AC)<sup>3</sup>. 
The campaigns handled in the online description are:

### ACLOUD
Arctic CLoud Observations Using airborne measurements during polar Day [ACLOUD](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~ehrlich/ACLOUD_wiki_doku/doku.php) (data at {cite:t}`EhrlichCollectionDataSources2019`) - Polar 5 (remote sensing) and Polar 6 (in-situ) out of Longyearbyen
### AFLUX
Airborne measurements of radiative and turbulent FLUXes of energy and momentum in the Arctic boundary layer [AFLUX](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~ehrlich/AFLUX_wiki_doku/doku.php?id=start) (data at {cite:t}`MechCollectionDataSets2021`) - Polar 5 (remote sensing and in-situ) out of Longyearbyen
### MOSAiC-ACA
MOSAiC Airborne observations in the Central Arctic [MOSAiC-ACA](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~ehrlich/MOSAiC_ACA_wiki_doku/doku.php?id=start) (data at {cite:t}`MechCollectionDataSets2021a`) - Polar 5 (remote sensing and in-situ) out of Longyearbyen
### HALO-(AC)<sup>3</sup>

In addition, the flight tracks and sea ice coverage of the Polar Airborne Measurements and Arctic Regional Climate Model Simulation Project [PAMARCMiP](https://www.ac3-tr.de/overview/observations/pamarcmip-2018/) have been included.

During [ACLOUD](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~ehrlich/ACLOUD_wiki_doku/doku.php) the campaign Physical feedback of Arctic PBL, Sea ice, Cloud And AerosoL (PASCAL) was conducted by the research vessel Polarstern. The ship track of the Polarstern RV is part of the data catalog. This will be important for analyzing Polarstern overflights.

## Platforms
During HALO-AC<sup>3</sup>, three aircraft will be operated by the members of (AC)<sup>3</sup>.
