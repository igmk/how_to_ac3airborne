  abstract = {The HALO‚Äì(ùíúùíû)3 aircraft campaign was carried out in March and April 2022 over the Norwegian and Greenland seas, the Fram Strait, and the central Arctic Ocean. Three research aircraft ‚Äì the High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO), Polar 5, and Polar 6 ‚Äì performed 54 partly coordinated research flights on 23 flight days over areas of open ocean, the marginal sea ice zone (MIZ), and the central Arctic sea ice. The general objective of the research flights was to quantify the evolution of air mass properties during moist and warm-air intrusions (WAIs) and cold-air outbreaks (CAOs). To obtain a comprehensive data set, the three aircraft operated following different strategies. HALO was equipped with active and passive remote sensing instruments and dropsondes to cover the regional evolution of cloud and thermodynamic processes. Polar 5 carried a similar remote sensing payload to HALO, and Polar 6 was instrumented with in situ cloud, aerosol, and trace gas instruments focusing on the initial air mass transformation close to the MIZ. The processed, calibrated, and validated data are published in the World Data Center PANGAEA as instrument-separated data subsets and listed in aircraft-separated collections for HALO (Ehrlich et al., 2024a, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.968885), Polar 5 (Mech et al., 2024a, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.968883), and Polar 6 (Herber et al., 2024, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.968884). A detailed overview of the available data sets is provided here. Furthermore, the campaign-specific instrument setup, the data processing, and quality are summarized. Based on measurements conducted during a specific CAO, it is shown that the scientific analysis of the HALO‚Äì(ùíúùíû)3 data benefits from the coordinated operation of the three aircraft.},

  abstract = {The Microwave Radar/radiometer for Arctic Clouds (MiRAC) is a novel instrument package developed to study the vertical structure and characteristics of clouds and precipitation on board the Polar 5 research aircraft. MiRAC combines a frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar at 94\&thinsp;GHz including a 89\&thinsp;GHz passive channel (MiRAC-A) and an eight-channel radiometer with frequencies between 175 and 340\&thinsp;GHz (MiRAC-P). The radar can be flexibly operated using different chirp sequences to provide measurements of the equivalent radar reflectivity with different vertical resolution down to 5\&thinsp;m. MiRAC is mounted for down-looking geometry on Polar 5 to enable the synergy with lidar and radiation measurements. To mitigate the influence of the strong surface backscatter the radar is mounted with an inclination of about 25‚àò backward in a belly pod under the Polar 5 aircraft. Procedures for filtering ground return and range side lobes have been developed. MiRAC-P frequencies are especially adopted for low-humidity conditions typical for the Arctic to provide information on water vapor and hydrometeor content. MiRAC has been operated on 19 research flights during the ACLOUD campaign in the vicinity of Svalbard in May‚ÄìJune 2017 providing in total 48\&thinsp;h of measurements from flight altitudes \&gt;2300\&thinsp;m. The radar measurements have been carefully quality controlled and corrected for surface clutter, mounting of the instrument, and aircraft orientation to provide measurements on a unified, geo-referenced vertical grid allowing the combination with the other nadir-pointing instruments. An intercomparison with CloudSat shows good agreement in terms of cloud top height of 1.5\&thinsp;km and radar reflectivity up to ‚àí5\&thinsp;dBz and demonstrates that MiRAC with its more than 10 times higher vertical resolution down to about 150\&thinsp;m above the surface is able to show to some extent what is missed by CloudSat when observing low-level clouds. This is especially important for the Arctic as about 40\&thinsp;\% of the clouds during ACLOUD showed cloud tops below 1000\&thinsp;m, i.e., the blind zone of CloudSat. In addition, with MiRAC-A 89\&thinsp;GHz it is possible to get an estimate of the sea ice concentration with a much higher resolution than the daily AMSR2 sea ice product on a 6.25\&thinsp;km grid.},

The latter campaign was closely connected to the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition. Comprehensive datasets of the cloudy Arctic atmosphere have been collected by operating remote sensing instruments, in-situ probes, instruments for the measurement of turbulent fluxes of energy and momentum, and dropsondes on board the AWI research aircraft Polar 5. In total, 24 flights with 111 flight hours have been performed over open ocean, the marginal sea ice zone, and sea ice. The datasets follow documented methods and quality assurance and are suited for studies on Arctic mixed-phase clouds and their transformation processes, for studies with a focus on Arctic boundary layer processes, and for satellite validation applications.

  abstract = {Global warming is amplified in the Arctic. However, numerical models struggle to represent key processes that determine Arctic weather and climate. To collect data that help to constrain the models, the HALO‚Äì(ùíúùíû)3 aircraft campaign was conducted over the Norwegian and Greenland seas, the Fram Strait, and the central Arctic Ocean in March and April 2022. The campaign focused on one specific challenge posed by the models, namely the reasonable representation of transformations of air masses during their meridional transport into and out of the Arctic via northward moist- and warm-air intrusions (WAIs) and southward marine cold-air outbreaks (CAOs). Observations were made over areas of open ocean, the marginal sea ice zone, and the central Arctic sea ice. Two low-flying and one long-range, high-altitude research aircraft were flown in colocated formation whenever possible. To follow the air mass transformations, a quasi-Lagrangian flight strategy using trajectory calculations was realized, enabling us to sample the same moving-air parcels twice along their trajectories. Seven distinct WAI and 12 CAO cases were probed. From the quasi-Lagrangian measurements, we have quantified the diabatic heating/cooling and moistening/drying of the transported air masses. During CAOs, maximum values of 3 K h‚àí1 warming and 0.3 g kg‚àí1 h‚àí1 moistening were obtained below 1 km altitude. From the observations of WAIs, diabatic cooling rates of up to 0.4 K h‚àí1 and a moisture loss of up to 0.1 g kg‚àí1 h‚àí1 from the ground to about 5.5 km altitude were derived. Furthermore, the development of cloud macrophysical (cloud-top height and horizontal cloud cover) and microphysical (liquid water path, precipitation, and ice index) properties along the southward pathways of the air masses were documented during CAOs, and the moisture budget during a specific WAI event was estimated. In addition, we discuss the statistical frequency of occurrence of the different thermodynamic phases of Arctic low-level clouds, the interaction of Arctic cirrus clouds with sea ice and water vapor, and the characteristics of microphysical and chemical properties of Arctic aerosol particles. Finally, we provide a proof of concept to measure mesoscale divergence and subsidence in the Arctic using data from dropsondes released during the flights.},
