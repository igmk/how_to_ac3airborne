# Introduction
Welcome to the world of AC<sup>3</sup> airborne data! It is a collection of python code examples to get you started with the airborne data collected during the various airborne campaigns within the German DFG project - TRR 172, "ArctiC Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes, and Feedback Mechanisms (AC<sup>3</sup>) {cite:t}`WendischArctiCAmplificationClimate2017`, a joint research initiative of the Universities Leipzig (Leipzig Institute of Meteorology, LIM), Cologne (Institute of Geophysics and Meteorology, IGM), and Bremen and of the research institutes TROPOS (Leipzig) and Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI Bremerhaven and Potsdam). The document is permantently growing and changing and might never be finished. It follows the concept and ideas of the work done within the [EUREC4A](https://howto.eurec4a.eu/intro.html) community.

## Idea
The book chapters show datasets that are accessible online, i.e., you donâ€™t have to download anything in advance. Most datasets are accessed via the [ac3airborne intake catalog](https://github.com/igmk/ac3airborne-intake), which simply said takes care of the links to datasets in their most recent version. Most of the data is located on the [PANGAEA](https://www.pangaea.de/) database if already published or on the [Nextcloud server of the AC<sup>3</sup> project](https://cloud.ac3-tr.de) if they are still preliminary ot never planed to be published on PANGAEA. Some of the data that is publically available and only post-processed to fit the needs are hosted on a server at University of Cologne. 

By implemented caching capabilities, it is only necessary to download the data the first time they are used. The scripts typically contain at minimum a description on how to get a specific dataset and some simple plots of basic quantities. Most chapters include additional information from aircraft flight segments or further meta data, sometimes more sophisticated plots, or also a combination of variables from different datasets. In addition, some small tools are included to work with auxilliary data like sea ice coverage or land-mask. 

## Airborne campaigns within AC<sup>3</sup>

The campaigns handled in the online description are:

- Arctic CLoud Observations Using airborne measurements during polar Day [ACLOUD](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~ehrlich/ACLOUD_wiki_doku/doku.php) (data at {cite:t}`EhrlichCollectionDataSources2019`) 
- Airborne measurements of radiative and turbulent FLUXes of energy and momentum in the Arctic boundary layer [AFLUX](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~ehrlich/AFLUX_wiki_doku/doku.php?id=start) (data at {cite:t}`MechCollectionDataSets2021`)
- MOSAiC Airborne observations in the Central Arctic [MOSAiC-ACA](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~ehrlich/MOSAiC_ACA_wiki_doku/doku.php?id=start) (data at {cite:t}`MechCollectionDataSets2021a`)

In spring 2022, the [HALO-AC3](https://halo-ac3.de/) campaign will be conducted with the three aircraft HALO, Polar 5, and Polar 6. HALO will operate out of Kiruna (Sweden), whereas Polar 5 and Polar 6 will be based in Longyearbyen (Svalbard, Norway).

In addition, the flight tracks and sea ice coverage of the Polar Airborne Measurements and Arctic Regional Climate Model Simulation Project [PAMARCMiP](https://www.ac3-tr.de/overview/observations/pamarcmip-2018/) have been included.

During [ACLOUD](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/~ehrlich/ACLOUD_wiki_doku/doku.php) the campaign Physical feedback of Arctic PBL, Sea ice, Cloud And AerosoL (PASCAL) was conducted by the research vessel Polarstern. The ship track of the Polarstern RV is part of the data catalog. This will be important for analyzing Polarstern overflights.
